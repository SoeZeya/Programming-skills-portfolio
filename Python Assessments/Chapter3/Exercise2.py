Chapte3 Exercise2
Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just

printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
personalized with the person’s name.
"""
names= ["Jeff", "Nick", "Ralph", "Kelvin", "Peter"] #creating a list store the names

for x in names: #using for loop to print message 
  
   print("Hello, ",x, "You are awsome!!!") #printing same message with the different name
